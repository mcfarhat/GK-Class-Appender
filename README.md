=== Short Summary ===

The GK Class Appender is a wordpress plugin that allows our common user to apply easily, and without coding, specific pre-defined classes to specific HTML entities/tags.

== Description ==

The plugin aims at adding support from within wordpress, and without editing the code, to dynamically assign an already defined class to element available on the front of wordpress posts, pages, and screens.

The idea came to mind as a client of mine needed to perform this functionality, and for someone who does not easily deal with code, I decided to make this functionality available as a wordpress plugin, and make his editing job much easier.

Upon installation and activation, a new menu item is created, Gk Class Appdender, which allows setting up specific class names to specific tags. While you may enter a single tag name, yet the identifier can be in the format of a tag, an id (pre-pended with #), or even a class (pre-pended with a .) and hence would actually affect all matching tags. Basically any format suitable for jQuery is supported.

The screen is very simplistic, in that is only asks for the tag and the class, and then the save button, as simple as that.

Once data is saved, it will reload upon accessing the page, and you can definitely edit your selection here and save again.

3. Visit the new page by clicking on the GK Class Appdender menu link in the backend left menu tab
